Reference implementation of Decaf parser.	
Report errors to Yuxuan Shui and C. R. Ramakrishnan

README.txt:	this file
decaflexer.py	PLY/lex specification of Decaf tokens.
		Also defines "errorflag" used to signal error during scanning/parsing.
decafparser.py	PLY/yacc specification of Decaf grammar.
		The encoded grammar rules appear in the same order as in decaf manual.
		Defines "from_file" function that takes a file name and parses that file's contents.
		"from_file" returns True if no error, and False if error.
decafch.py	Driver: processes arguments and gets file name to pass to decafparser.from_file
		Decaf programs are assumed to be in files with ".decaf" suffix.
		Argument given to decafch may omit this suffix; e.g.
				python decafch test
		will read from test.decaf.
